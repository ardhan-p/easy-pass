# EasyPass: An easy way to store passwords on your Android device.

## Description

EasyPass enables Android users to create encrypted login items and store them in a safe place. This negates the need for users to remember the passwords for countless of accounts.

To encrypt the local database, EasyPass utilises a hashed master password for its encryption key. It uses PBKDF2 (Password-Based Key Derivation Function) cryptographic function to achieve this. The reason that this was chosen was that it increases the resistance against rainbow table attacks and dictionary attacks, making it more secure.
